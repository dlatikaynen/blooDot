  The Start and tutorial area
  The start area is The Skullery, which is a liminal space restaurant
  adjacent to...

  
  Prof. Tessa Yang's orchard
└───────────────────────────

  A garden, where anything she grows there is viciously poisonous,
  painfully harmful, deadly:
  - nutmeg
  - jequirity
  - angel's trumpet
  - belladonna
  - odollam
  - foxglove
  - mobile hogweed
  - ouabain

  The exit is marked with a sign reading "Safe way home".
