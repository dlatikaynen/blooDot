The spinal staircase
Night in the scullery
Teepee for my bunghole
Give the dog a bone
Give the frog a loan

We're permadeath until we obtain the snail of life

I have a portfolio
in my bungholio

I would hate for my bungholio
to get polio

Nicaragua
Agua for my BunGHolE

Lake Titicaca
I need Pikata
for my BunGHolE

Where I come from
there is but one BunGHolE
There will be others after me

You cannot escape
the ALmighty BunGHolE
Run as you may

Stigmatata
From Lake Titicaca
